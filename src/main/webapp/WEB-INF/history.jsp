        <h1><b>HISTORY OF CBTC</b></h1>
        <P>CBTC was established on the basis of the recommendations made by the various Working Groups, an idea took
            shape and this ultimately resulted in the formulation of the "Cane and Bamboo Technological Upgradation
            and
            Networking Project”.</P>

        <h2><b>Seminar Summary</b></h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">This Seminar was the first step of a UN system initiative aimed at
            supporting the Government of India Bamboo Development Plan, announced by the Prime Minister on World
            Environment Day, 5 June 1999. It resulted from a visit, in March, Mr. Carlos Magarinos, Director General
            of UNIDO and was organized by the Ministry of Environment and Forests and UNIDO through a Regular budget
            project with technical and coordination support from UNDP, FAO and the International Network for Bamboo
            and Rattan (INBAR), based in Beijing, China. The seminar was oriented around six themes: resource
            development, food processing and products, handicrafts, manufactured or industrial products,
            construction and energy and “high-tech” considerations in an effort to encompass all the most important
            development issues for this valuable raw material. The programme is shown as Annex 1, which, although
            not indicating exactly the actual timing, represents the format of alternating plenary and thematic
            sessions.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The opening ceremony was attended by many senior officials of the Ministry
            including representatives of bamboo-producing States, technical institutes and industry who heard
            introductory remarks from the organizers and supporters as well as from four State Ministers, Mr. D. N.
            Tiwari, member of the National Planning Commission and Mr. Suresh Prabhu, Minister of Environment and
            Forests. The introductory remarks made by Mr. Robert Hallett on behalf of the Director General of UNIDO
            comprise Annex 2.<br><br>The Forest Ministers from Manipur, Mizoram, Meghalaya and Nagaland all spoke of
            the considerable bamboo resources available in their States that were not being managed nor used to
            their full potential. The Minister from Manipur called for a "Bamboo Development and Marketing Board"
            and appreciated the thematic approach. The Minister from Mizoram noted that 66% of growing stock was in
            his State and drew attention to the flowering of its bamboos in 2007 and the immense challenge faced to
            avoid the famine caused by the rats which would follow. He proposed the establishment of a "Bamboo
            Research Institute", a study tour of bamboo processing South East Asian countries and invited a team of
            experts to visit the Northeast States.<br><br>The Minster from Meghalaya called for eco-development for
            communities for adding value to the untapped resources and said that three District Forest Development
            Agencies had already been set up. He spoke of the need for seedlings, cooperatives and marketing as well
            as fiscal support. The Minister from Nagaland underscored the importance of bamboo for his people by
            saying that "Nagas eat bamboo from root to leaf". Bamboo was used in virtually every aspect of life but
            technical and financial support was essential for development despite the relative success of the 7-year
            rotation due to slash and burn methods.<br><br>Dr. Tewari spoke of trade development. and the policy and
            legal changes needed for the development of all uses and for the "greening of India", saying that for
            fuller value added bamboo must appear on the "positive list" for trade.<br><br>Mr. Prabhu stressed the
            need to stop pollution and redefine development, saying that clean air and water were the real
            fundamental needs of people – over food, shelter and clothing. He referred to his meeting with Mr.
            Magarinos noting that bamboo development fell into all three of UNIDO’s priorities – environment,.
            employment and economy. He supported the need for a gender bias as mentioned by Ms. Brenda McSweeney,
            UNDP Resident Representative & UN Resident Coordinator. Bamboo should not be referred to as "poor man's
            timber" owing to the predominant role of women in its processing and use. In fact, the term "Green
            Gold", used by Dr. Sastry, INBAR in his presentation on international developments and trends was more
            apt since there were many uses not related to timber or wood and so this better reflected its huge
            potential. He announced that all Ministries would support the Bamboo Development Plan and recommended
            that each should set up a "Bamboo cell" for coordination.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>After the opening, working groups were formed to review past efforts,
            recommend policy changes and
            define actions. The main (preliminary) recommendations were:</b><br><br>a) Improve statistical and
            inventory data on bamboo and silvicultural and management practices.<br><br>b) Undertake large-scale
            plantings with investment in nurseries and careful selection of species linked to end-use
            requirements.<br><br>c) Examine the appropriate definition of bamboo as a minor forest product,
            non-timber forest product or timber and its economic and resource management implications.<br><br>d)
            Consider delegating authority for certification for eco-labelling and transit permits to
            Panchayats.<br><br>e) Identify species for food products, especially shoots, raise plantations and
            involve local farmers through rural extension centres and model large-scale farming/forestry
            units.<br><br>f) Prepare techno-economic feasibility studies on fresh and processed bamboo shoot
            production, and on traditional knowledge base for converting to high value-added products from shoots
            and leaves.<br><br>g) Establish prototype demonstration units as processing incubators-cum pilot plants
            in two areas: Mizoram and Malnad, Karnataka.<br><br>h) Complement the ongoing UNDP, KVIC project on
            handicrafts with additional technical inputs aimed at increasing the supply and quality of finished
            articles and semi-processed products for further industrial processing under the headings: raw material,
            processing and treatment, technology and tools, product development and design, training, financial
            support, marketing, policy issues and networking.<br><br>i) Create 10-20 "Common Facility Centres" for
            collection, pre-processing and marketing of bamboo as well as for training and demonstration and common
            purchasing benefits.<br><br>j) Promote available technologies for bamboo mat based composites, adapt
            advanced technologies for manufacturing bamboo strip board and laminates for furniture, truck and
            container flooring, railway coaches and interior paneling and decorative uses; (N.B. Some products will
            be displayed at World Expo 2000, Hanover, Germany).<br><br>k) Develop split bamboo products such as
            toothpicks, chopsticks, incense sticks, ice cream spoons and other specialty items for export as well as
            bamboo for packaging and for agri-horticulture accessories.<br><br>l) Form a "Furniture Manufacturers
            Association", with a bamboo section, catalogue and develop bamboo processing machines and equipment,
            promote products through architects and designers by Internet, exhibitions and displays.<br><br>m)
            Coordinate with the INBAR programme to develop a National Bamboo Building Code of Practice, produce
            guidelines for construction with bamboo.<br><br>n) Document and re-engineer traditional bamboo house
            construction, produce appropriate manuals, build demonstration houses; and train in improved
            methods.<br><br>o) Include bamboo in MoEF plantation programmes with the aim of producing fuel and other
            bamboo products for rural areas.<br><br>p) Prepare techno-economic feasibility studies on: conversion of
            bamboo residues into high energy fuel by briquetting, gasification, flash pyrolysis and identify
            appropriate technologies; on conversion of bamboo residues into cattle feed; and on production of
            pharmaceuticals and other high value materials.</p>
