        <p>Cane and Bamboo Technology Centre has facilitated the emergence of a new scenario in the North Eastern
            India. Almost two decades of its existence in this part of India has struck the imaginations of the
            population here and led them on to dream about the possibility of a healthy future. Inevitably a future
            replete with expanded livelihood opportunities stemming unendingly from the right and rich harvest of
            Bamboos. CBTC strongly believe in the thrust which will be felt globally following our role as the
            matchmaker of the human resource, bamboo and technology.</p>

        <p>CBTC was incorporated with the objective of organizing the hitherto untapped bamboo sector of NE India
            which is a significant occupant of its topography, culture and customary practices since time
            immemorial. Its formal existence came into being as a coordinated effort headed by North Eastern
            development Finance Corporation (NEDFi) along with the Department of Science and Technology, Govt of
            India, UNIDO and UNDP. CBTC is the field implementation agency and forms a part of the Technology
            Management Program (TMP) which is a joint effort of Govt of India and UNDP. CBTC has embarked on a new
            phase of programmes and projects in the bamboo sector with renewed vigor under the aegis of North
            Eastern Council (NEC). It can be said that CBTC is one of core outreach programme of NEC for giving a
            shift to the economy of NE in the positive direction. The progress of these two organizations has been
            acknowledged by the greater community as the change agent whose need was continually felt in the region.

        <p>Bamboo signifies passing on the inheritance of a environmentally cleaner and a healthy greener world to
            our future generations. The tall wonder grass keeps on generating solutions to our ever increasing needs
            and problems in a seemingly everlasting way. Economic potential of bamboos in the developing and
            underdeveloped countries has grounded countless livelihood projects world wide. The dependence on bamboo
            for aesthetic and utility benefits is also growing at a compounded rate in the First World.
